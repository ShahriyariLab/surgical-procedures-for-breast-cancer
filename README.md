# surgical-procedures-for-breast-cancer
Breast cancer has one of the most heterogeneous tumors. Since the outcome of breast cancer treatments  strongly depends on the tumor subtypes, several studies investigated the outcome of surgical procedures for each of these subtypes. On the other hand, it has been shown that the outcome of breast cancer treatments is significantly different between black and white patients.  In this study, to determine the optimal surgical procedure for each racial group of breast cancer patients with a given tumor subtype, we analyze clinical and gene expression data sets of 1082 patients with breast invasive carcinoma.
